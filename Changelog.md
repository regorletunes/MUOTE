V0.4. My first documented version. I didn't document prior versions due to them being not intended for release, so i guess this is "technically" v0.1.
Made the base, a buggy mess that can mostly get the work done of repleacing the third digit of every hitobject (the timing of it).
I hope to do much more with this.
Todo: 
-add metadata interface including better filename and such 
-add step by step guide (readme)
V0.4.1. Well, i have already outpaced the capability of the main extension that i am using. So i will soon have to bascially design the whole thing again from the ground up. Better Variables is GARBAGE, while looking good, it does not get the job done.
I added the basics of a metadata system, it does not fully change the file yet, but it is getting much better.
V0.5 
I tiptoed around the terribleness of BV, so i got it done. Metadata's shitty interface works now. its really bad though, not very user-friendly.
I finally got a decently presentable product done at least. i still want to do more with this, and a main thing i want to do now is:
-add better filename "fetch old filename" or somthing like that for the exporting.
-MAKE IT NOT UGLY PLSSSS
