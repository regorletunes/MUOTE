V0.4. My first documented version. I didn't document prior versions due to them being not intended for release, so i guess this is "technically" v0.1.
Made the base, a buggy mess that can mostly get the work done of repleacing the third digit of every hitobject (the timing of it).
I hope to do much more with this.
Todo: 
-add metadata interface including better filename and such 
-add step by step guide (readme)
V0.4.1. Well, i have already outpaced the capability of the main extension that i am using. So i will soon have to bascially design the whole thing again from the ground up. Better Variables is GARBAGE, while looking good, it does not get the job done.
I added the basics of a metadata system, it does not fully change the file yet, but it is getting much better.
