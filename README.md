# MUOTE
The most useless osu! tool ever.
this is my first github post, please no bully :)
feel free to make better, just no bully

Osu! may detect it as corrupted, but as of my tests the maps work perfectly fine.

# HOW TO USE

1. Open Muote.exe or the HTML version.

2. Import your map. if a interface doesn't load after step 3, please press R to restart it.

3. Next, you can edit your map. (randomize, time it, change meta)

4. When you are done, click Export

5. Then, you can put your map in osu as a .osu file!

# USES

Randomize: randomizes the entire map, putting all objects at random timings.

Timing: puts all objects in a map at one timing point.

Change Metadata: you can change metadata w-w
